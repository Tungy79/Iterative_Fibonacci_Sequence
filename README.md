Explanation of this Iterative Approach in Python:

    def fibonacci_iterative(n_terms):: 
        Defines a function that takes n_terms (the desired number of terms) as input.

    Input Validation (if n_terms <= 0, elif n_terms == 1):
        It first checks for invalid input (n_terms <= 0) and prints an appropriate message.
        It handles the special case where n_terms is 1, printing only 0.

    a, b = 0, 1:
        Initializes two variables, a and b, with the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1. This is a convenient way to do multiple assignments in Python.

    print(a) and print(b):
        The first two terms (0 and 1) are printed directly since the loop starts from the third term.

    for _ in range(2, n_terms)::
        This for loop iterates n_terms - 2 times. We start range from 2 because the first two terms have already been handled. The _ (underscore) is used as a variable name when you don't need to use the loop counter itself, just iterate a certain number of times.

    next_term = a + b:
        Calculates the next term in the sequence by adding the previous two terms (a and b).

    print(next_term):
        Prints the newly calculated next_term.

    a = b:
        Updates a to the value of b. The "old" b now becomes the "new" a for the next iteration.

    b = next_term:
        Updates b to the next_term that was just calculated. This sets up a and b for the next calculation in the loop.
